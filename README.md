## Task 1 notes:

Please see the db_structure.pdf ([link](../blob/main/db_structure.pdf)) as a reference for my implementation of what can be a valid mapping storing mechanism.
That DB structure is translated in dataservice.ts, which I kept as a code collection for simplicity and time saving of testing this task.
   

## Task 2 notes:

- node v18.17.1, used jest for testing
- npm install & npm run test;
- Source code is in the ./src , used jest tests.    
- Field value manipulation logic is unfinished, please ignore this and try see a bigger picture - I have no free time left until next week.
- I initially though on doing mapping by using Standard keys as a startig point, instead of switching lookup collections based on the api call direction, but the implementation seemed to be too complicated and messy so I dropped that idea, ready to discuss.
